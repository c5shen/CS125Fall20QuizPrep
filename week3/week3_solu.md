### Warm-ups solutions
1. ```java
    int[][][][] arr = new int[w][x][y][z];
    ```
    where **w, x, y, z** are some integers.

2. Some error indicating ```NullPointerException```.

3. null.

4. It will give you an array of non-rectangular dimensions, where the first inner array has dimension of 1, second has 3, third 5, ...

5. When you want your block of codes run at least once.

6. ```bash
    javac your_file.java
    ```

7. ```var```

8. **continue** allows you to continue running the loop but "skip" the codes below the **continue**. The codes will print out 0, 3, 6, 9.
